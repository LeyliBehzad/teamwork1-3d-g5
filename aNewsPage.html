          White House Covid coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said on Wednesday that
          the newly updated Covid boosters will be available to teens and adults
          "in a few short weeks." "I believe itâ€™s going to be available and
          every American over the age of 12 will be eligible for it," Jha told
          NBC News' Lester Holt. The new boosters target the omicron subvariants
          BA.4 and BA.5, as well as the original strain of the virus. BA.5
          accounts for nearly 90% of new Covid cases in the U.S., according to
          the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Food and Drug
          Administration will determine how well the updated shots protect
          against the virus, Jha said, adding that he expects that they should
          "work much better at preventing infection transmission and serious
          illness" than the current boosters. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White
          House's chief medical advisor, told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on
          Thursday that he expects that the updated booster should provide
          stronger protection against any new variants that may emerge in the
          near future.
